# MOM Notes : 
  - for create, use `ansible-playbook ./src/rds.yml --tags "load,create" -vvv > src/logs/create.log`
  - for anything else, use `ansible-playbook ./src/rds.yml --tags "describe|start|stop|<anything>"`

## Points before start
> Setting Retention period 0 indicates that it's not a automated backup, change it manually
> Backup window and maintainence window should be length of 30 minutes least
> Valid A_types are prod and dev
> Storage types are (standard | gp2 | io1)
> Port valid value should be from this range 1150-65535
> IOPS constrains : Constraints: Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.

## IOPS has to be integrated, because I was not having IOPS available account
## Pre-requists
	boto with python - python2 (alreayd in reahat), create a small installation task in this playbook itself
	pip, pip install boto, boto3, botocore
	ansible, yum install ansible


## First instrcution,
 - Job is scheduled on the basis of tag and template for example I want to create a database the use
 	> ansible-playbook rds.yml --tags "load, create"
 	If I want to modify database
 	> ansible-playbook rds.yml --tags "load, modify"
 - Both operations use same template file so sample template for the creating/modifying is in samples. You have to write configurations and put your JSON in the `vars/template.json` file
